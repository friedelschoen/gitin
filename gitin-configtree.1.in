.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gitin-configtree
.I <yaml|ini|toml>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gitin-configtree
is a command-line tool that reads configuration files in YAML, INI, or TOML format from standard input, parses the content, and outputs the data as HTML. The output HTML structure reflects the nested nature of the original configuration file, with lists and dictionaries represented by HTML lists.

This tool can be useful for displaying configuration information in a web-friendly format and is capable of handling typical features of each configuration format.
